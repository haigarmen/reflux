reflux
======

The Reflux installation centres around how we see ourselves, how our media-engulfed environment reflects on us, how distorted those reflections can become through digital channels and what we leave behind as digital detritus. We experience transformative moments when comparing our view of ourselves with other perspectives. This installation strives to create a moment for its participants to reflect on the way that the digital world sees us - what kind of picture it  forms of us? Is it a flattering or diminutive? Accurate or Abstract? Current or Retrospective?

The installation could be characterized as a digital mirror that asks what your name is and composes a poster based on images and data it has found about your name. Your experience with the installation concludes with your own printed portrait poster that you'll be able to take home with you.

This project is created by Haig Armen (haig [at] liftstudios.ca) for exhibit at the Centre for Digital Media in April 2014
